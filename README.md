**Chemist.ry : A Pharmacy Management System**

**Introduction**: <br>This project focuses on designing and implementing a Pharmacy Management System to streamline the management of pharmaceutical stores. By creating a comprehensive database of available medicines, the system aims to improve accuracy, safety, and efficiency. The  provides robust inventory statistics, ensuring effective oversight and management of drug stocks.

**Description on the topic:** <br>
This program can be used in any pharmaceutical shops having a database to maintain. The software used can generate reports, as per the user‚Äôs requirements. The software can print invoices, bills, receipts etc. It can also maintain the record of supplies sent in by the supplier. Here, the admin who are handling the organization will be responsible to manage the record of the employee. Each employee will be given with a separate username and password.

**Problem Definition**:<br>
The aim of the project is to create an effective software to help the pharmacist to maintain the records of the medicines, handle user details, generate invoice, check and renew validity and provide a scope of communication between users by using inbuilt messaging system. Pharmacy management system deals with the maintenance of drugs and consumables in the pharmacy unit. This pharmacy management system is user friendly.

**Objectives**<br>
-> **Primary objective**<br>
‚Ä¢ To gain practical experience by modeling a software based on real world problem. <br>
‚Ä¢ To understand how to work on Front-end (Java) and Back-end (MySQL) by using server(wamp).

-> **Secondary objective** <br>
‚Ä¢ To develop an application that deals with the day to day requirement of any pharmacy.<br>
‚Ä¢ To develop the easy management of the medicines (drugs). <br>
‚Ä¢ To handle the inventory details like sales details, purchase details and stock expiry and quantity.<br>
‚Ä¢ To provide competitive advantage to the pharmacy.<br>
‚Ä¢ To provide details information about the stock on details necessary and help locate it in shop easily. <br>
‚Ä¢ To make the stock manageable and simplify the use of inventory in the pharmacy.<br>

**Hardware and software tools:**<br>
The system services and goals are established by consultation with system user. They are then defined in details and serve as a system specification. System requirement are those on which the system runs.<br><br>

‚öôÔ∏è	**Hardware Requirements:**<br>
1. Computer with either Intel Pentium processor or AMD processor.<br>
2. 1GB+ DDR RAM<br>
3. 40GB hard disk drive<br>


üíª	**Software Requirements:**<br>
‚Ä¢  Windows/ MacOS/ Linux operating system.<br>
‚Ä¢	JRE and JDK.<br>
‚Ä¢	MySQL server (WAMP or XAMPP or any)<br>

The goal of this application is to manage the medicines and various function of the pharmacy. <br><br>
**List of modules:**<br>
1. Login page<br>
2. Home page<br>
3. Company<br>
4.	Purchase<br>
5.	Drugs<br>
6.	Sales<br>
7.	User/Settings<br>
8.	Messaging<br>


**Result and Discussion**<br>
By using MySQL commands and its database this website Pharmacy management tends to store all the data received from the users including drugs sales details and the profit made by the owners are all in this data base. This website allows the user to generate invoices for sales, check expiry and quantity remaining of the drugs. It also provides user with options to renew validity and add more drugs into the store and update the database accordingly. By using xampp server these database commands are easily initiated into the database and the ER diagram with relational schema diagrams helps us to make the structure of the database faster and it was easier to make them understand the needs of the website.<br>
